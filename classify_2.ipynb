A little over a year ago, I was running a 15:30 mile and hitting 1.7 miles in 30 minutes. Today, I ran a 12:20 mile and finished 2.2 miles in 30 minutes. The pace I was listing as \"sprint\" last year is now my average pace. Take that stupid scale. If you are new at all this, the lesson I can pass on from this is WRITE IT ALL DOWN.
